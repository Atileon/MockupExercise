# From mockup to code

This is a simple page site takin as reference the 'axit-screenshot.png' image 

It's based on Bootstrap with some Javascript (JQuery)

---
## The Site

This site is for a fictious Pastry Shop


---
### The colors

Colors was choiced aiming to reflect sweetness with light colors (pink, light-blu and soft green)

---
### The Mockup choice

It's because the posibility to show images while there's a description too disposed in a fluent layout that fall down in a zigzag way

This layout will take users till the end of page showing the sweet products :baby:
